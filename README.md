# Maven-Market




## Introduction

Maven Market is a grocery store chain that owns stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 


# Problem Statement

In the Maven Market project, the responsibility is to transform raw data into insightful reports and dashboards. These tools enable the management team to monitor KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product trends. This work empowers the team to make informed decisions and optimize business strategies based on these valuable insights.


## Process
 ```Data Cleaning and Transformation```
 
The information gathered from a Udemy course underwent thorough cleaning in Power BI using Power Query. This meticulous process included addressing missing, duplicated, and disorganized values to ensure data accuracy. Additional columns were created, and tables were merged to enhance comprehension of the data.

```Building Relationship```

Once the data was cleaned using Power Query, the refined data was loaded. In the Model view, relationships between tables were established, a crucial step in generating unbiased visualizations rooted in accurate and cleaned data. Careful selection of the primary key and concealing the foreign keys ensured the visualizations were unbiased, preserving all pertinent information. This method guarantees precise and equitable visual representations, truly reflecting the insights derived from the data.

```Table View```

In the table view, we selected specific data categories for columns to display the right formats. For instance, in the "Territory" category, we chose the "Country" column from the data category to ensure accurate visualizations, matching the correct countries in the data.

```Report View```

Special calculations called DAX measures were used to find the real KPIs and assist in creating charts like graphs, lines, and bars. These charts show important information in an easy-to-understand way.An interactive dashboard was developed, offering users the capability to filter and visualize data seamlessly. This user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience, allowing users to explore the data, apply filters, and gain valuable insights effortlessly.


## Dashboard

This report gives an in-depth analysis of how well Maven Market is performing. This report captures the topline performance of the product. The matrix shows lot of information regarding the products sold in relation to the total sales, profit margin and the return rate. Drill through function is available to take a look at the product brand by name. I used KPI cards as an indicator to draw attention and show the element of trending and performance to the individual numbers and most important metrics of the business like the current month's revenue, transactions and profit which all indicated that the monthly target goal was reached.

## Challenges Faced 

``` Creating  Measures``` 

Creating the measures that is essential for the visualization was crucial and the most challenging problem I have faced while building this project.To make sure building the essential measure in order to make the visualization more in depth and help the managers to find out the key findings easily.

``` Building Visualizations`` 

Building the actual needed visualization from the scratch was challenging for me, as I have to decide which graph to choose for which visualization.


## Learnings

``Data Quality Importance``

The project reinforced the critical importance of data quality. Clean and accurate data is foundational for meaningful analysis and actionable insights.

``Effective Visualizaion`` 

Effective visualization,showing the important and in depth visualization according to the viewers is crucial. It helps to build a dashboard with the things that they need to know.
